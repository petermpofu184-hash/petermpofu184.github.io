      <h2>Working as a Group of Six</h2>
      <p class="article-meta">Using Tuckman’s stages of group development</p>

      <p>This semester, our group was made up of six members, and our task was to prepare and present a class presentation. During the <strong>Forming</strong> stage, we were still getting to know one another. Everyone was respectful and willing to participate, although one member arrived late to our first meeting. Although it caused a small delay, we quickly adapted and continued planning without conflict.</p>

      <p>In the <strong>Storming</strong> stage, we experienced minimal disagreement—there were no major misunderstandings or arguments. The main issue was punctuality at the first meeting, which we resolved by agreeing to respect each other's time. Open communication and clear expectations helped us move forward.</p>

      <p>During the <strong>Norming</strong> stage, roles were assigned and accepted. Each member had a specific responsibility for the presentation, and we began to coordinate and support one another. Our shared goals aligned and collaboration improved.</p>

      <p>At the <strong>Performing</strong> stage, the group worked efficiently: members completed their parts, practiced the presentation, and refined slides together. I was a team member rather than the leader, but I contributed actively and learned from others' strengths. We found that when everyone is dedicated, the group's work saves time and becomes more effective.</p>

      <p>Finally, at the <strong>Adjourning</strong> stage, we delivered the presentation and reflected on the experience. Working with others helped me identify and polish my own weaknesses. Overall, the group work was a valuable experience in teamwork, time management, and shared responsibility.</p>
