      <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
      <p class="article-meta">300–600 words reflection</p>
      <p>Starting college has been both exciting and challenging for me. One of my biggest worries in the beginning was how I would socialize and make new friends. I had taken a gap year before starting university, so when I arrived, I didn’t know anyone. Walking into a new environment where everyone seemed to already know someone made me feel unsure and isolated. Slowly, I began interacting with a few classmates, and over time I learned that stepping out of my comfort zone was the only way to grow.</p>

      <p>Another major challenge was <strong>time management</strong>. College is very different from high school—no one forces you to study, attend classes, or submit work on time. It is your responsibility. I struggled to balance attending lectures, completing assignments, studying, and still having personal time. I often found myself studying late at night or even at the last minute before deadlines. I realized that this was not because I was lazy, but because I needed to learn how to plan my time better and stay disciplined.</p>

      <p>When it came to choosing my programme, things didn’t go exactly as planned. I grew up in a family that is passionate about engineering—mechanical, automotive, electrical, and even aerospace. Naturally, I wanted a career that combined all of these fields, so I first aimed for <strong>Mechatronics Engineering</strong>. However, life took a different turn and I ended up choosing <strong>Computer Systems Engineering</strong>. What attracted me was the word <em>“systems”</em>, because systems exist in every kind of engineering—mechanical systems, electrical systems, software systems. I realized that technology controls and connects all these fields, and studying systems engineering would still allow me to explore the kind of innovation I’ve always been interested in.</p>

      <p>I study best at night because there is less noise and fewer distractions. The quiet allows me to focus better. However, I still struggle sometimes with leaving things until the last minute—so I know my time management still needs improvement. But I am working on it step by step.</p>

      <p>When I think about achievements, I don’t feel like I have done anything very big yet. But I remind myself that sometimes <strong>small achievements still matter</strong>. I am proud that I made it to university, especially after taking a gap year. I am also proud that I managed to start my own online store, which taught me about responsibility, business, and independence.</p>

      <p>Overall, my academic journey so far has taught me resilience, self-discipline, and patience. I am still growing, still learning, and still improving—but I am confident that this journey is shaping me into the person and professional I want to become.</p>
