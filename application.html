      <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

      <p>I am writing to apply for an industrial attachment position at your company as part of the requirements for my programme in BSc Computer Systems Engineering at Botswana Accountancy College. I am eager to gain practical experience in systems engineering, software development, and integrated technologies that link hardware and software systems.</p>

      <p>Through my coursework and personal projects, including launching an online store and developing small automation scripts, I have developed practical skills in HTML, CSS, basic Python, and problem-solving. I am hardworking, a team player, and committed to learning on the job. I believe an attachment at your organization will allow me to contribute while furthering my practical knowledge.</p>

      <p>I have attached my CV for your review. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can start the attachment as needed.</p>

      <p>Yours faithfully,<br>
      Peter Junior Mpofu</p>
